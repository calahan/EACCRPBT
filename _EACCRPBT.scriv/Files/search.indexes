            <Title>Concerns - Emissions, Biomass, Land Area</Title>
            <Text>The scale of our proposed intervention prompts concerns about environmental impacts. For example, algal biomass that concentrate toxins found in polluted water may itself be classified as toxic waste, requiring additional processing to render it suitable for further applications. Biofuel production could remove up to half of the biomass as carbon, doubling the concentration of toxins in the residue and reducing landfill volumes and transportation costs compared to the original biomass. An effective testing program will be essential to ensure that compromised biomass receives proper treatment. As landfilling is the default fate of the biomass for current production units, uses that both generate revenue and lower residue volume can improve the economics. Another possible impact is emissions from floways. Obviously net oxygen will be released, but many marine algae also emit dimethyl sulfide (DMS) {Charlson et al., 1987, #54604}, a volatile organosulfur compound known to impact climate by nucleating clouds over the oceans. To date, no studies of DMS emission from ATS™ floways, marine or fresh, have been performed. Increased cloud cover could increase Earth’s albedo, slowing global warming, but could also potentially negatively impact crop and photovoltaic productivity. Other environmental impacts that merit consideration relate to the extent of algal cultivation area required. While algal floways are efficient at non-point nutrient removal on an areal basis, they will nevertheless require conversion of land from current uses to algae cultivation. Where feasible, non-agricultural land, brownfields, or even building roofs might be candidates for conversion, but where agriculture is most concentrated, existing crop production would have to be traded for algae production, requiring careful cost-benefit analysis. Wading birds are frequently observed in production floways, browsing on productivity inhibiting invertebrate algal grazers and adding additional nutrients to the water. This phenomenon and likely various others will recur and expand along with expanded algal cultivation. While not comprehensive, these examples represent questions that will need to be answered as algae cultivation expands from the few hectares now in production to the tens of millions of hectares and more needed.</Text>

            <Text>Nutrient data {Potter et al., 2010, #43603} are organized on a 0.5’ × 0.5’ grid of latitude and longitude, with 9,318,244 total grid cells, 698,788 having N and P data and 228,398 having P data only (Fig. 2). Values represent kg of excess nutrient per grid cell, and are positive for N but positive or negative for P. We consider only positive values, as nutrient deficits are not transferrable among grid cells or basins. Excess N and P total 5 × 1010 kg and 9.1 × 109 kg, respectively. Excess N per grid cell ranges from 0 kg to 2.8 × 106 kg. Excess P per cell ranges from 0 kg to 5.8 × 105 kg {West et al., 2014, #62583}. Half of the excess N and P is accounted for by 6.8% and 7.0% of their respective grid cells. The 405 major basins curated by the Global Runoff Data Center are responsible for 77% of global nutrient excess, for both N and P (Table A1). Excess N per curated basin ranges from 0 to 5.1 × 109 kg yr-1. Excess P per basin ranges from 0 kg yr-1 to 1 × 109 kg yr-1. Half of the nutrient excess is contributed by five (N) or six (P) basins (Table 1). The Yangze contributes the most N, while the Ganges contributes the most P.</Text>

            <Title>The Threat</Title>
            <Text>The resource demands of Earth’s population, which may exceed eleven billion people by 2100 {United Nations, 2017, #94734}, will likely continue to intensify stresses on ecosystem services {Boyd and Banzhaf, 2007, #49938; World Resources Institute, 2005, #12568}. Among the most pressing threats is transgression of key planetary boundaries by overloading of the global N and P biogeochemical cycles via excess agricultural fertilizer/manure application and incompletely treated sewage {Bouwman et al., 2005, #64003; Bouwman et al., 2013, #412; Boyer et al., 2006, #93219; Carpenter et al., 1998, #80361; MacDonald et al., 2011, #24675; Moe and Rheingans, 2006, #86296; Potter et al., 2010, #43603; Sims et al., 1998, #57108; Steffen et al., 2015, #78923 ;World and UNICEF, 2017, #51383}. Fresh and marine waters receiving these excess nutrients are experiencing harmful algal blooms (HABs) and their concomitant negative effects on ecosystem and human health with increasing frequency and extent  {Anderson et al., 2011, #64929; Fu et al., 2012, #46278; Glibert et al., 2005, #83785; Hallegraeff, 1993, #70258; Heisler et al., 2008, #9953}.  Additionally, unsustainable fossil fuel extraction and combustion are overloading the global C biogeochemical cycle, warming our climate and acidifying our oceans {Cai, 2003, #31497; Ciais et al., 2014, #20246; Mostofa et al., 2015, #46684; Pachauri et al., 2014, #63677; Prentice et al., 2001, #15935}. Human activity and these biogeochemical cycles are tightly coupled with photosynthesis, as primary production fixes environmental C, N, and P into biomass{Field et al., 1998, #18706}. Thus if photosynthesis could be greatly expanded globally and the resulting biomass effectively managed, stresses on multiple Earth systems could be relieved. With a sufficiently large increase in primary production, negative impacts on N and P cycling could be stabilized and eventually reversed, with concomitant major relief of stress on C cycling.</Text>

One practice intended to mitigate dilute N and P pollution is the constructed treatment wetland (CTW) {Hoffmann et al., 2011, #95223; Kivaisi, 2001, #28974; Vymazal, 2010, #45132}. CTWs embed some excess P in the soil while volatilizing much of the excess N, and to a lesser extent sequester these nutrients as biomass, with effective P removal requiring increased complexity and expense {Vymazal, 2010, #45132; Fasching et al., 2015, #79924}. Due to linkage with photosynthesis, CTWs also sequester some C in biomass. While low operating costs are claimed for CTWs, these estimates have not generally included long term harvesting to counter maturation and degradation {Keller and Knight, 2004, #5792}; a 20-30 yr harvest cycle requires major expense for dredging, transportation and sequestering or processing the spoil. Further advantages ascribed to CTWs include increased biodiversity, mitigation of pathogens and additional pollutants, and applicability over a range of geographical, climatic, and socio-economic environments {Semeraro et al., 2015, #92954; Kivaisi, 2001, #28974}. However, the areal effectiveness of CTW nutrient removal tends to be so low that treating an agricultural basin to pre-industrial levels of N and P with would require converting a substantial proportion of a basin, possibly including crop growth area, to wetlands (See Results). The floating treatment wetland (FTW), an aquatic analog of CTWs, imposes additional operational burdens, is potentially viable only in relatively calm waters - greatly limiting its applicability - and can increase, rather than decrease, nutrient loading if not managed properly {Stewart et al., 2008, #29842; Wang and Sample, 2014, #10440; Winston et al., 2013, #66703}. If expanded to a size functional for treating a major lake or estuary, a FTW would likely interfere with other commercial and recreational uses.

            <Text>Where concentrated pollutants are released, as from sewage treatment plants or factories, effective industrial treatment is feasible but expensive, and is actively, if sporadically, performed mostly in wealthy countries {Elimelech, 2006, #46773; Environmental Protection Agency, 2007, #89392; Høibye et al., 2008, #64492; Høibye et al., 2008, #64492}. However, even with cleanup of concentrated N and P via expanded industrial treatment {Ribaudo et al., 2001, #100325}, agriculture unavoidably produces global nonpoint N and P pollution from application of fertilizer and manure that infiltrates nearby surface and subsurface waters, with septic systems and cesspools contributing additional N and P in much of the world {Cairncross, 2003, #94435}. Beyond cleanup of excess N and P, CO2-specific solutions that compress or chemically fix this pollutant from industrial facilities have poor economics and depend on storage in sites of uncertain stability {Cuéllar-Franca and Azapagic, 2015, #17420}{Esteves and Morgado, 2012, #55792}. Fortifying the oceans with limiting nutrients such as iron could remove large quantities of nutrients {Boyd et al., 2007, #54273; Buesseler et al., 2008, #24311; Naqvi and Smetacek, 2011, #29270} by stimulating large plankton blooms that then sink, but the long-term impacts of this approach are poorly understood, and the loss of potentially valuable biomass weakens the economics. It is essential to seek more affordable and effective solutions.</Text>

            <Title>ATS Intro</Title>
            <Text>Here we evaluate the capability of the algae cultivation practice known as algal turf scrubbing (ATS) {Stewart, 2004, #96157; Adey et al., 2011, #74672} to intervene in humanity’s overloading of the N, P, and C biogeochemical cycles. One of us (Adey) is the inventor of this process, a reliable technology that harnesses rapidly growing benthic algal polycultures, also known as periphyton, confined within an open-field photobioreactor, to photosynthetically remove N, P, C, and other aquatic pollutants from point and nonpoint fresh and marine waters {Adey et al., 1996, #59863;tRothman et al., 2013, #23278}, simultaneously oxygenating the cleaned effluent, increasing its pH, and producing copious biomass (ATS is a trademark, and Algal Turf Scrubber a registered trademark, of Ecological Systems Inc., the primary R&amp;D entity for the technology; these are licensed to HydroMentia Technologies LLC). ATS has been deployed at hectare scale for decades, with low capital and operational costs compared to other nonpoint treatment solutions, demonstrating reliable operation and productivity equal to or better than local high-performance agriculture. ATS introduces what is essentially a new agricultural crop, nonspecific algal biomass, low in water consumption and independent of the extractive industries producing fertilizer and other commodities essential for the highest agricultural productivities. ATS has been demonstrated at more than forty locations for polishing water from secondary sewage treatment, treating raw and digested animal manure, recycling aquaculture/mariculture wastewater, removing nutrients from dredge spoil, and cleaning agricultural runoff (Fig. 1E, Table 1). Mean annual ash-free dry weight (AFDW) productivity in temperate and sub-tropical zones routinely exceeds 55 t ha-1 yr-1 (20 ton ac-1 yr-1); recent work supports the likelihood of increasing productivity, with annual AFDW means of 150 t ha-1 yr-1 (54 ton ac-1 yr-1) published {Adey et al., 2013, #773}.</Text>

            <Title>ATS Operation</Title>
            <Text>Typically, ATS operates in a single-pass mode, with influent traversing the floway once before returning to its source. Multiple passes may instead be performed, either with the effluent from one floway used as the influent for another, emulating a single longer floway, or by recirculating water through the same floway multiple times before discharge. A typical production-scale facility occupies ~1 ha, treating ~4.0 × 107 L d-1 (~1.1 × 107 gal d-1), with larger volumes handled using multiple instances of a modular design. Single-pass mode requires less capital and operational expense (CapEx and OpEx) than more complex operational modes, but can usually accomplish only 5-15% removal of N and P, as carbon limitation, arising along the floway due to removal of this nutrient as it is incorporated into biomass during photosynthesis, reduces areal productivity and thus nutrient uptake. Introducing CO2 at intervals along the floway can reverse carbon limitation, increasing areal productivity and providing the capability to reduce nutrient loading to oligotrophic levels. Photosynthesis drives the buffer system towards its higher-pH, CO32- dominated profile, upgrading the water beyond simply removing pollutants. Discharge of this higher pH water can potentially be an issue. However, the HCO3-/CO32- buffer strength is inherently low, and in this case dilute with so much HCO3- removed, so a final treatment step of mixing it with some untreated input water may be desirable in some circumstances. These considerations suggest design and operation options that can be optimized for specific situations. For N-limited basins, a subset of the floway area can be operated for P recovery by using relatively long floways (up to 300 m (980 ft)), driving the pH above 8.5 and chemically precipitating phosphate salts and producing high-P biomass. For P limited basins, there is no correspondingly simple operation to precipitate surplus N-containing salts. However, a subset of the floways can be operated for P precipitation, with the recovered P recycled into floways with surplus N.</Text>

            <Title>Abstract</Title>
            <Text>Humanity is degrading multiple ecosystem services, potentially irreversibly. Two of the most important human impacts appear to be excess agricultural nutrient loading in our fresh and estuarine waters and excess carbon dioxide in our oceans and atmosphere. Large-scale global intervention is required to slow, halt, and eventually reverse these stresses. Cultivating benthic polyculture algae within controlled open-field photobioreactors is a practical technique for exploiting the ubiquity and high primary productivity of algae to capture and recycle the pollutants driving humanity into unsafe regimes of biogeochemical cycling, ocean acidification, and global warming. Expanded globally, 4.9 × 107 hectares of algal cultivation area, properly distributed, is capable of incorporating global excess nutrients. while simultaneously sequestering appreciable excess carbon. While obviously a major capital and operational investment, such an algal recycling project is comparable in magnitude to the construction and maintenance of the global road transportation network. Beyond direct amelioration of critical threats expanded algal cultivation would produce a major new commodity flow of biomass, and because of coupling among Earth systems, would additionally help relieve additional stresses. </Text>

{Muller et al., 2015, #27640}

We are doing geoengineering, and it will work.

Can “green” water infrastructure really provide the kind of ecosystem services that “built” water infrastructure can? 

Need to refer to resistance to “water’s destructive extremes” - reference the Hydromentia hurricane component of the S-154 report.

The challenge is to support a growing population desiring an essentially middle-class type of existence

Their reference is (3), and they are talking 9.6 billion people, mostly urban, needed a much more concentrated source of ecosystem services.

OECD (4) estimates a doubling in “water abstraction” 

$400 billion needed in the US between 2011 and 2030 just to sustain drinking water supplies.

Most of the new infrastructure growth will be in China and India, Africa and Latin America.

Global warming will reduce “green” water flows in many areas.

Dams vs. desalinization (12).

Potable water, sanitation and wastewater treatment are needed no matter what. Irrigation. Storage.</Text>

            <Title>Description</Title>
            <Text>An ATS facility is characterized by a shallow, flat, inclined (0.5-2% slope) exposed surface (the floway) (Fig. 1A), either roughened or lined with a high surface-area fabric to provide a growth substratum. A wave- or pulse-generator directs influent into the floway along its upper contour (Fig. 1A,B), producing a shallow (2-5 cm (0.7 - 2 in) deep) flow coursing downslope. Cells of diverse algal taxa, ubiquitous in surface waters, adhere to the substratum and rapidly propagate, maturing into a community of attached filaments and trapped cells (Fig. 1B, C). Cell growth fixes dissolved N, P, C, and other solutes and particles into the developing biomass, removing them from the influent. Weekly to biweekly harvest removes the majority of the biomass, staging the remnant algal cells for another production cycle. Continuous operation ensures perpetual sampling of the influent for new algal species and strains, increasing the facility’s biodiversity over time. Pulsing imposes turbulent flow, increasing light penetration and mixing, allowing even dilute nutrient sources to support high productivity {Adey and Steneck, 1985, #91961}. Photosynthesis drives the buffer system to high pH via CO2 and HCO3- uptake, and supersaturates the effluent with O2. If present, heavy metal ions are incorporated into the biomass, and many toxic organic molecules are removed or detoxified {Adey et al., 1996, #59863}.

They are specifically talking about biodiversity.

Generation of “free” algal biomass.

Most interventions may require more offset area than impact area for “no net loss”, and require extensive monitoring. How do we avoid trading genreating negative impacts as reported by Palimer and Filoso (2009).

Maron et al (2012) review programs. There may be time lags in response to an intervention. Perceived changes vs. actual changes may affect public response. Also, societal response to the ecological loss impacts social acceptability of the offset.

They provide a stylized model of offset applications.</Text>

Their references: (15) for future populations. (17) for fate of P in soils. (18) IAASTD baseline scenario. We can recapitulate their work by extrapolating ATS to their worst-case scenario (2050 EX). (11) for their own paper.

Their population estimates are UN medium, what is the reference (S1A).

We should establish a % conversion of arable land to ATS. For each region, how much non-arable land is suitably located, how much of that can be converted to ATS, and then how much of the remaining (arable) land must then be converted. And then what is the impact on the remaining arable land and the downstream watersheds?

What are the estimates and justifications for N mineralization and P retention? We need to apply those to flows within each watershed.

Where does their EXE come from and can we get it and recompile it or re-implement it?

Their scenario is assuming tweaking the system as is, whereas our scenario is to use the surplus as a resource

Glossary:
Nutrient surplus
Nutrient recovery - calculated by equations S5 (crop) and S6 (livestock)
NUE, PUE: nutrient use efficiency. Grams of dry matter per gram of N or P. AKA “partial factor productivity”. Equation S5.

Model:
The SI document refers to the model data availability. R script should download from scratch and prepare it for processing. Some data are only available from the corresponding author - do we need those data sets? (IMAGE and IAASTD). Where are the source code and executables?

They request to see a pre-submission version of the article to make sure the data description is correct.

Input parameter values: N excretion in manure (1, 7). P excretion in manure (8-12). Rates constant except for 1900 and 1950 (13).

Assumptions:
Available manure N is 60% of total N.

VF CWs need 1-3 m^2 PE^-1 vs 5-10 for HF (PE: population equivalent). VF has more operational costs due to pumps and timers. And other electromechanical equipment. What does this mean in terms of volumetric flow rate? And in terms of concentration in the influent.

Can work out LHFL and areal loading only indirectly. Perhaps convert ATS functionality into PE.</Text>

            <Title>Limitations</Title>
            <Text>Our approach suffers from several limitations. Because we approximate the effort needed to globally recycle pollutants, rather than create a detailed simulation, we chose a round number (100 years) for our project duration, and a simple algorithm for spending: exponential growth starting at a defined spending rate and ending at a level that satisfies the pollutant recycling rate. This approach to financing and schedule is rudimentary, but the large scale of our proposed intervention makes it practically impossible to incorporate all the different financing, permitting, sociopolitical situations affecting jurisdictions of interest. Our linear model relating latitude to productivity ignores climatic differences along latitude lines, and can only be corrected by a comprehensive set of pilot studies. The eventual costs for N and P recycling are a substantial percentage of the gross world product {The World Bank, 2017, #21801}, suggesting that the commodity flow of algal biomass will affect markets for other commodities, but we do not address these impacts. The basin component of our analysis focuses on 405 curated basins. A more comprehensive analysis would consider the remaining basins, but visual inspection of Figures 2C and 2D suggests that our prioritization would be little changed, especially in the highest priority range. Visual inspection of Figures 2A-2C also reveals patterns of lacunae (for example an approximately Arizona-shaped void in western North America) suggesting that the nutrient data is also incomplete. However, even if formally incomplete, the coverage is nevertheless sufficiently extensive that our main conclusions would also likely be little changed with more complete data.

Planetary boundaries- Guiding human development on a changing planet

For the Weeds paper, briefly go into this and focus on the importance of N and P; since we must do that anyway, this technique also pushes back against the Land System change and Climate change, which is rising. As it fixes ecosystems, it pushes back against loss of Biosphere integrity and Ocean acidification. Talk a bit about where to do it, how much fuel you could get for all the dirty water. Fixing, or partially fixing, five of the nine.

ATS is a land use that can increaser BII

Ozone looks like we caught it and may be going back up.

CO2 is not as bad as other things yet, by slowing it and reversing it early, the aragonite problem will likely be less widespread

Would we be removing silicon from the system too much? Perhaps some residue would be desirable to re-put back into the hydrology network. Using Tg y-1 as a unit. P and N. Estimate total offflow.

The current global rate of application of P in fertilizers to croplands is 14.2 Tg P y-1 (52, 53)

The N boundary has been taken from the comprehensive analysis of De Vries et al. (5),

Instead of curtailing or redistributing, we could in situ reduce the flow while creating biofuel. Total biofuel worldwide, 

More detail on the development of the P and N boundaries is given in 33, where we also emphasize that the pro-posed P and N boundaries may be larger for an optimal allocation of N (and P) over the globe

Biofuels may be a bust anyway but if they’re going to use algae, blah blah blah.

The Department of GE should have a readout along these lines. A constantly updated figure on the internet.

blue water [from rivers, lakes, reservoirs and re-newable groundwater stores (59)] as the global-level control variable and 4000 km3/yr as the value of the boundary

Remind that unlike irrigation, almost all of the water returns within minutes to the hydrology network.

We base our control variable on the concept of environmental water flows (EWF), which de-fines the level of river flows for different hydrological char-acteristics of river basins adequate to maintain a fair-to-good ecosystem state (60–62).
The Variable Monthly Flow (VMF) method (33, 63) was used to calculate the basin-scale boundary for water.

Our new estimates of the current status of the water use boundary—computed based on grid cell-specific esti-mates of agricultural, industrial and domestic water with-drawals—are shown in Figs. 2 and 3, with details in figs. S7 and S8.

evidence that Earth is a single complex, integrated sys-tem—that is, the boundaries operate as an interdependent set [e.g., (94)] - we would have to reassess the PBs in the face of major biofuel manufacture

Our update has also relied on post-2009 assessments of individual boundaries by the relevant expert research communities; examples include phosphorus (3), nitrogen (5), biosphere integrity (7), freshwater use (5, 63), and novel entities [with a focus on chemicals, (28, 73)]. Finally, some new analyses have been undertaken specifically for this paper: (i) a freshwater use PB based on the environmental water flow (EWF) approach (33, 63); (ii) the linkage of the phosphorus and nitrogen boundaries via the N:P ratio in growing crop tissue (33); and (iii) the use of major forest biomes as the basis for the land-system change PB (33).

            <Title>Gross Expense</Title>
            <Text>To estimate an upper limit to the gross expenses required to implement global N and P recycling, we assume worst case CaEx, and OpEx, a relatively short floway lifespan, unexceptional algal productivity (Table 3), and no future reductions in excess C, N, and P. We adopt an investment scenario starting with an initial annual spending rate that increases by a fixed percentage each year for 100 years (Table 4, Figs. 4A, 4C), then remains at that level for the next 100 years, setting the initial spending at a level that results in complete recycling at year 100. This exponential spending increase combined with the limited lifetime of an ATS facility produces the “ringing” phenomenon apparent in biomass production (Figs. 4B, 4C). Our parameters insure that once the spending rate becomes constant, the total operational area is never below the minimum needed to achieve the required recycling. In our worst case scenario for N and P recycling, spending begins at $4.9 × 108 yr-1and grows to $6.1 × 1012 yr-1. In our best case scenario, spending begins at $1.8 × 108 yr-1and grows to $2.3 × 1012 yr-1.

[Moved from elsewhere]
 CapEx can vary; we assume a range of $2.5 × 105 ha-1 ($1.0 × 105 ac-1) (monetary values in approximate 2017 US dollars) where minimal site preparation is required, to $1.0 × 106 ha-1 ($4.0 × 105 ac-1) with complex site preparation. OpEx can range from $4.0 × 104 ha-1 yr-1 ($1.6 × 104 ac-1 yr-1) for single-pass operation to $7.0 × 104 ha-1 yr-1 ($2.8 × 104 ac-1 yr-1), for more sophisticated operations.

[Moved from elsewhere]
 A 1.0 ha (2.5 ac) facility producing 5.5 × 101 t yr-1 of algal compost sold for $1.0 × 102 t-1 ($9.1 × 101 ton-1), would generate $5.5 × 103 yr-1, offsetting roughly fourteen percent of $4.0 × 104 yr-1 OpEx, and improving the economics.</Text>

Paragraphs: The Threat;

From the abstract:

(1) Degraded water quality from increased nutrient pollution promotes the development and persistence of many HABs and is one of the reasons for their expansion in the U.S. and other nations;
(2) The composition–not just the total quantity–of the nutrient pool impacts HABs;
(3) High-biomass blooms must have exogenous nutrients to be sustained;
(4) Both chronic and episodic nutrient delivery promote HAB development;
(5) Recently developed tools and techniques are already improving the detection of some HABs, and emerging technologies are rapidly advancing toward operational status for the prediction of HABs and their toxins;
(6) Experimental studies are critical to further the understanding about the role of nutrients in HABs expression, and will strengthen prediction and mitigation of HABs; and
(7) Management of nutrient inputs to the watershed can lead to significant reduction in HABs.

Note, this is USA biased, and is not intended to be a thorough review. However it is recent and is a decent summary.

See perhaps Anderson, 1989; Smayda, 1990; Hallegraeff, 1993; Anderson et al., 2002; Glibert et al., 2005a or better yet some more recent review. GEOHAB, 2001, HARRNESS, 2005

Karenia brevis - associated with low inorganic N:P, regenerating blooms. Modeled in GoM.
Karlodinium veneficum - stimulated by growth of cryptophytes (prey?)
Pseudo-nitzcschia australis - domoic acid production enhanced by growing on urea. Also by copper or iron limitation, or very high copper.
P. cuspidata - Most toxic when grown on nitrate.
P. multiseries - Most toxic with iron or copper limitation or very high copper.
Trichodesmium blooms enhanced by iron deposition from dust, leading to indirect blooms in K. brevis.
P. minimum - in Chesapeake Bay increasing over decades with N loading.
Aureoumbra lagunensis - regenerating blooms in Laguna Madre
Synechococcus - blooms from P injections
Aureococcus anophagefferens - mid-Atlantic brown tides, secondary to other algae stimulated by excess N that remineralizes.
Alexandrium spp. - modeled in the Gulf of Maine
Alexandium lusitanicum - loses toxicity after many years in culture.
A. anophagefferens - used in small-scale mesocosm modeling. Blooms in Long Island embayments

Unpredictable episodic events can deliver pulses of nutrients that cause blooms. Unpredictable ones like storms are difficult to manage. Storms and climate variability affect timing of freshwater flow.

Chesapeake: Spring nitrate introductions cause diatom blooms which die and sink, releasing N in summer supporing flagellates including dinoflagellates. Thus dose:yield models are inadequate.

Brown tides - pelagophytes - able to uptake N, P, C from organic components

Eliminating raw sewage in Lake Washington: Edmondson, 1970, Lake Erie: Ashworth, 1986, Mumford Cove: Harlin, 1993, Chesapeake: Jaworski, 1990; Seto Inland Sea: Okaichi, 1997; Long Island Brown Tides decreasing: Gobler et al., 2005; Nuzzi and Waters, 2004; Gobler et al., 2005; Dzurica et al., 1989; Lomas et al., 1996; Berg et al., 1997, 2002; Mulholland et al., 2002, 2004; Gobler and San˜udo-Wilhelmy, 2001; MacIntyre et al., 2004; Gobler et al., 2005; Chesapeake brown tides increasing: Trice et al., 2004; Glibert et al., 2007

The idea that even long term storage and release of nutrients can be countered using ATS. The idea of using algal biomass to restore long-term habitat degradation that may be increasing blooms. Cloern, 2001. This is a landscape-level change that is thought to be, and probably is, necessary. We do prevention where possible, and mitigation where necessary. What is the iterative process we need?

Sensors and predicting should help demonstrate the effects of ATS on a water body.

Laboratory studies depend on maintaining cultures which may change over time, limiting their relevance. Also, in the wild, there many be many different strains, which may have quite different responses, such as ability or iniability to grow on a specific nutrient type, so studies drawing conclusions from a single species should be avoided.

“trophodynamics” 

Classic whole-lake studies in Canada: (Schindler, 1987, 2006). Smaller-scale mesocosm studies: (Glibert, 1998; Grane´ li and Turner, 2002; Buskey et al.,2003; Vadstein et al., 2004). Ocean studies: (reviewed by de Baar et al., 2005).

Examples of bloom reduction by decreasing nutrient inputs:
Lake Washington: (Edmondson, 1970); Lake Erie: (Ashworth, 1986); Mumford Cove (Harlin, 1993); Potomac R.:(Jaworski, 1990); Seto Sea: (Okaichi, 1997); (reviewed by Imai et al., 2006). Long Island brown tides: (Gobler et al., 2005, (Nuzzi and Waters, 2004; Gobler et al., 2005).). Maryland (Trice et al., 2004; Glibert et al., 2007). What were the original concentrations, what were they reduced to, what are the predictions of lowered even more.

Long time scales can be involved due to long-term storage of nutrients in sediment: see if there are any Conowingo Dam or other dam reports. Again, argues for use of ATS. If ecosystem dyanmics are altered (“permanently”), nutrient reduction alone may not be sufficient - fortunately we deliver oxygen as well, although loss of benthic habitat and alterations in food webs may need to be addressed as well.

While prevention is preferable, where HABs exist, they must be eradicated

The iterative nature of the management process.

To the extent that microalgae are interesting, what have those thinkers thought about total mass balance? Plus, one can apply the logic to ATS algae. Plus, they are talking biodiesel, whereas we should be talking mixed alcohols and HTL oil.

There is a high bullshit factor here. Perhaps only their methods are interesting. We already can do half of their optimistic potential, with better technoeconomics.</Text>

            <Title>Surfaces</Title>
            <Text>Recent experiments have demonstrated greater than twofold improvement in ATS™ biomass productivity using three-dimensional growth substrata rather than the usual two-dimensional screens {Adey et al., 2013, #773}. To understand this higher productivity it may be worth considering the importance of surface topography at multiple scales, starting with the molecular. Surfaces can catalyze chemical reactions by spatially organizing a population of reactant molecules according to a geometry that favors the desired reaction. The plasma membranes of prokaryotic cells similarly surface-organize macromolecules and macromolecular complexes, facilitating rapid and highly organized reaction throughput on both sides of the surface and across the membrane. Eukaryotic cells further exploit the capabilities of surface organization via their varied and extended intercellular network of nuclear, Golgi, mitochondrial, chloroplast, and vacuolar membranes. The microstructure of plant and animal organs and macrostructure of forest canopies are further iterations of this theme of surfaces optimizing performance, at ever larger scales. Providing a suitable three-dimensional surface for algal colonization and growth similarly organizes algal cells to take better advantage of the nutrients and illumination than available from two-dimensional surfaces. Three-dimensional substrata provide more surface area for colonization, and with the proper topography maintain or extend the turbulent mixing that breaks through the laminar flow boundary layer of the algal filaments and provides changing currents that oscillate the filaments back and forth, allowing light to penetrate deeper into the turf. Additionally, the denser turf provides a matrix that traps algal cells that would otherwise slough off of the floway. All of these effects contribute to more than double the productivity expected from the 2-dimensional substrata originally employed. A major question here is how close to theoretical maximum primary productivity can optimization of growth substratum provide; the higher this number, the lower the total surface area is required to achieve a target nutrient removal rate.</Text>

            <Text>Technically, global recycling of N and P pollution arising from agriculture can be accomplished with expanded algae cultivation using ATS. The capital and operational investments required are large but tractable, but additional rewards would likely accrue through improving the global ecological situation. The primary difficulties are probably not technological, but rather both sociopolitical, with pluralities ever reluctant to address affronts for which they are collectively responsible, and macroeconomic, with such a large injection of biomass into world trade likely to prompt resistance from entities having a vested interest in the status quo. While an independent market for the enormous annual biomass production required for N and P recycling may not develop immediately, bounties for N and P capture, as well as for the associated C capture, are one way to pay for establishment and operation of a growing algal cultivation infrastructure. If biofuels or other commodities can be profitably manufactured from this algal biomass, subsidies can eventually be reduced or eliminated. One of the most cost-effective and beneficial uses for algal biomass may be returning it to local land as a soil amendment and fertilizer, potentially slowing or reversing the loss of arable land, delaying peak phosphorus, and reducing the energy and materials expended on manufacture of N fertilizer. This potential biomass sink very deep, likely able to accept biomass for at least as long as soil depletion has been occurring, with further agriculture and aquaculture applications also demonstrated. While additional efforts to either reduce application or reclaim excesses of nutrients may also be implemented, to date none of these appear as promising as algal turf scrubbing for global deployment.</Text>

            <Text>Nutrient data {Potter et al., 2010, #43603} are organized on a 0.5’ × 0.5’ grid of latitude and longitude, with 9,318,244 total locations, 698,788 having N and P data and 927,186 having P data (Fig. 2). Values represent kilograms of excess nutrient per cell, and are positive for N but positive or negative for P. We consider only positive values, as nutrient deficits are not transferrable among locations or basins. Excess N and P total # kg and # kg, respectively. Excess N per grid cell ranges from 3.9 × 10-6 kg to 2.8 × 106 kg. Excess P per cell ranges from −1.8 × 105 kg to 5.8 × 105 kg {West et al., 2014, #62583}. Half of the excess N and P is accounted for by 6.8% and 7.0% of their respective locations. The 405 major basins curated by the Global Runoff Data Center are responsible for 77% of global nutrient excess, for both N and P (Table A1). Excess N per curated basin ranges from 0 to 5.1 × 109 kg yr-1. Excess P per basin ranges from −6.8 × 107 kg yr-1 to 1.0 × 109 kg yr-1. Half of the nutrient excess is contributed by five (N) or six (P) basins (Table 1). The Yangze contributes the most N (5.1 × 109 kg yr-1), while the Ganges contributes the most P (1.0 × 109 kg yr-1).</Text>

            <Title>Sociopolitical Obstacles</Title>
            <Text>Sociopolitical and economic obstacles are more likely than technical ones to impede rapid expansion of algal cultivation. The continued growth in severity and size of HABs worldwide, in the presence of demands or mandates to address them demonstrates that the responsible political and commercial regimes can be reluctant to either create public goods of the required extent or mitigate inevitable ecosystem damage. However, in some jurisdictions progress has occurred. For example, governments of US states bordering the Chesapeake Bay are under federal mandate to address nutrient pollution, and one state - Maryland - now acknowledges ATS as a best management practice. Where public opinion can influence political will, whether through voting, legal action, protest, or self-actualized efforts such as crowdfunding or philanthropy, publicizing this and future examples may encourage jurisdictions, companies, and social organizations to consider adoption of expanded algal cultivation as part of their environmental portfolio. Systems of a few square meters are easily built, and the original patent has expired. Thus schools, associations, and entrepreneurs can build their own basic units, for learning, as a hobby, or as pilots for production systems.

            <Title>Success Indicators</Title>
            <Text>Because so much investment is required for complete N and P recycling, let alone C recycling, it may be prudent to start with projects of a scale affording early and definitive measures of success. The current global ecological situation derives from centuries of increasing human impact on ecosystem services. Centuries of increasing countermeasures might be required to completely reverse the damage. Initially, only local effects will be easily discernible, so focusing most of the initial investment on several smaller, less polluted basins, or on a few high priority basins, might be needed to deliver improvements as rapidly and visibly as feasible. Beyond water and biomass quality measurements themselves, initial measures of success could include reduction in the frequency, duration, and extent of HABs within the affected waters, improved health of reef and other ecologies in the estuaries and bays receiving the discharge, and improved agricultural metrics where algal biomass is applied to the soil. A preliminary project to completely treat a small basin could be mounted at considerably lower cost than that for our proposed global intervention.</Text>

            <Title>Biomass Fate</Title>
            <Text>Because the effectiveness of an ATS facility at removing N and P pollution correlates with its biomass productivity, the fate of the biomass is an essential consideration for project planning, ideally producing revenue to help offset treatment costs. Biomass produced from waters with low toxin concentrations toxins could be used in agriculture as a fertilizer/soil amendment {Mulbry et al., 2005, #24501}, as a source of compost {Shiralipour and Epstein, 2005, #22388}, or as an animal or fish feed{Adey and Purgason, 1998, #21268; Adey and Purgason, 1998, #27927}. Modern high-intensity agriculture has a negative side effect of degrading agricultural land; some estimates suggest that more than one third of originally arable land has been degraded by human impacts {Oldeman, 1994, #97184}. Returning organic carbon and nutrients from algal biomass to degraded agricultural land can potentially slow or reverse this trend, providing both food security and a sink for algal biomass. Biomass whose toxin concentration is unacceptable for agriculture or aquaculture must be processed to improve its quality if intended for food production, used for producing biofuels, other commodities, or higher value products, or landfilled, with any toxic residues from further processing either landfilled or recycled. </Text>

            <Title>ATS and Planetary Boundaries</Title>
            <Text>If globally distributed throughout the world’s river basins at large enough scale, increased algae cultivation could directly reverse the transgressions of planetary boundaries {Steffen et al., 2015, #78923} involving the N and P biogeochemical cycles. Here we estimate the scope of such an intervention both from a global perspective and by prioritizing major hydrological basins, as curated in publicly available nutrient and geospatial datasets. We discuss potential issues with land availability, economics, and sociopolitical considerations, ultimately extrapolating our analysis to complete recycling of net anthropogenic carbon. Our stance is conservative, as our intent is to determine an approximate upper limit to the effort needed to counteract these global threats and compare our proposed intervention with other global projects of similar scale. Improvements in biomass productivity and efficiencies in design, construction, and operation will reduce the investment required. Improving our model’s accuracy and precision will require a multi-year global program of building and operating pilot projects, affording development of a predictive productivity model and providing a more extensive knowledge base specific regional requirements.</Text>

            <Title>Summary</Title>
            <Text>Here we illustrate the contribution of excess global agricultural nutrients to impending transgressions of planetary boundaries involving biogeochemical cycling (Fig. 2A-B) {Steffen et al., 2015, #78923}, estimating the magnitude of investment required to counteract these transgressions using benthic algal cultivation, as implemented by ATS. If effect we are modeling a return to pre-industrial conditions of the majority of freshwater drainage. Such a complete effort may not be strictly necessary, and would likely extend beyond the referenced basins, but this conservative stance allows us to determine an approximate upper limit. We calculate that 

 Our upper limit on annual spending for, [#$ ha-1] of algal cultivation area, [#] or [#%] , demonstrates that even under worst case assumptions our project is tractable. Thus we additionally assume modest biomass productivity, include relatively high capital and operating expenses, and assume that net anthropogenic C emissions will continue unabated. We extend our analysis to the much larger and more speculative goal of stabilizing net anthropogenic C, partly to establish a scale of comparison, and partly to show that it is not inconceivable to at least partially manage C cycling through algae cultivation as well. To the extent that future efforts to improve ATS productivity and to curb anthropogenic C emissions succeed, the algal cultivation area needed to help manage this pollutant will also be reduced.</Text>

            <Title>Nutrient Excesses</Title>
            <Text>It is no surprise that the highest priority basins for N and P recycling are also the major highly productive agricultural basins. These basins are among the largest in surface area, and can thus be expected to be responsible for the majority of nutrient flows. This situation is compounded by the fact that agriculture is a low-margin enterprise. To maintain economic viability a farm must provide as much product per hectare as possible annually, often ignoring long-term considerations such as soil health if they impose unaffordable expenses. Increasing fertilizer application beyond the amount considered ecologically healthy increases production, but substantial quantities of this extra fertilizer are not retained in the soil and eventually percolate into drainage. Large basins that would already have high priority due to their size become even more important as their impact is multiplied by the economics of nutrient application. The question of which nutrient is limiting in a given basin is of importance when removal of either nutrient is expensive and the goal is to treat as little polluted water as possible in order to achieve the most improvement with limited funds. However, algal cultivation simultaneously removes both nutrients, although design and operational flexibility provides the ability to favor one nutrient over the other. Thus for our analysis, we assume that the limiting nutrient is recycled within the algal cultivation facility in order to remove the excess non-limiting nutrient, so it is the non-limiting nutrient that defines the total algal cultivation area needed. To avoid a bias in favor of one nutrient or the other, we prioritize grid cells and basins by combining N and P excesses into a single value (Fig. 2C, D).</Text>

            <Text>Globally, excesses of 5.0 × 107 t yr-1 (5.5 × 107 ton yr-1) N and 8.1 × 106 t yr-1 (8.9 × 106 ton yr-1)P  are applied to the 140 crops curated in theEarthStat datasets {West et al., 2014, #62583}. N-limitation is present in 513,622 grid cells and 224 basins, with P-limitation present in 185,166 grid cells and 95 basins (Figure 4A-B). Complete recycling of a limiting nutrient in a given grid cell or basin would leave an excess of the non-limiting nutrient. We thus compute, based on the latitude of each grid cell, the algal cultivation area required to recycle P in N-limited grid cells, and to recycle N in P-limited grid cells, summing these areas over each basin. We model productivity at the equator at 9.1 × 101 t ha-1 yr-1 (3.3 × 101 ton ac-1 yr-1). The highest latitude with excess nutrient data is 70°, with a productivity of 2.7 × 101 t ha-1 yr-1 (9.9 × 100 ton ac-1 yr-1). Globally, 4.9 × 107 ha (1.2 × 108 ac) of algal cultivation area is required for complete N and P recycling, with 4.7 × 107 (1.2 × 108 ac) required in N-limited grid cells and 2.8 × 106 ha (6.9 × 106 ac) required in P-limited grid cells. For nutrient recycling in the major basins curated in the GRDC data sets, a total of 3.8 × 107 ha (9.4 × 107 ac)is required, with 3.4 × 107 ha (8.4 × 107 ac)in N-limited basins and 2.8 × 106 ha (6.9 × 106 ac) in P-limited basins. The implied biomass, 3.1 × 1012 kg yr-1, is less than a thousandth of a percent of world net primary productivity, and approximately three hundredths of a percent of world agriculture. The mean productivity of all grid cells is 6.4 × 101 t ha-1 yr-1 (2.3 × 106 ton ac-1 yr-1).

            <Text>To identify the limiting nutrient for each location with excess nutrients, its P/N mass ratio, RPN was determined and compared to the P/N mass ratio of biomass computed from the Redfield ratios, RR = 0.0625, with locations having RPN &lt; RR considered P limited and locations having RPN ≥ RR considered N limited. To determine the amount of algal biomass needed to incorporate the non-limiting nutrient for each location, BLOC, we divided the excess of that nutrient, EN, in t yr-1, by the Redfield ratio for that nutrient RN, BLOC = EN/RN.  To determine the algal cultivation area needed to produce the required amount of biomass for each location, we modeled algal productivity as a linear function of latitude, LLOC, in degrees, PLOC = -0.91 t ha-1 yr-1 × LLOC + 91t ha-1 yr-1, and modeled the area of each location, ALOC, by considering it as a trapezoid centered on its associated coordinates, then divided the required biomass by PLOC.
