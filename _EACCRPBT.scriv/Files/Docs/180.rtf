\f0\fs32 \cf0 Sociopolitical and economic obstacles are more likely than technical ones to impede rapid expansion of algal cultivation. The continued growth in severity and size of HABs worldwide, in the presence of demands or mandates to address them demonstrates that the responsible political and commercial regimes can be reluctant to either create public goods of the required extent or mitigate inevitable ecosystem damage. However, in some jurisdictions progress has occurred. For example, governments of US states bordering the Chesapeake Bay are under federal mandate to address nutrient pollution, and one state - Maryland - now acknowledges ATS as a best management practice. Where public opinion can influence political will, whether through voting, legal action, protest, or self-actualized efforts such as crowdfunding or philanthropy, publicizing this and future examples may encourage jurisdictions, companies, and social organizations to consider adoption of expanded algal cultivation as part of their environmental portfolio. Systems of a few square meters are easily built, and the original patent has expired. Thus schools, associations, and entrepreneurs can build their own basic units, for learning, as a hobby, or as pilots for production systems.\
