\f0\fs32 \cf0 Globally, excess N and P applied to the 140 crops curated in the EarthStat datasets \{West et al., 2014, #62583\} total 5 \'d7 10^7 t (5.5 \'d7 10^7 T) and 9.1 \'d7 10^6 t (1 \'d7 10^7 T), respectively. We abbreviate metric tons with 't' and US tons with 'T'. Related to the Redfield ratios, these excesses imply N-limitation in 413,808 grid cells and P-limitation in284,980 grid cells (Figure 4A). As complete recycling of a limiting nutrient in a given grid cell or basin would leave an excess of the non-limiting nutrient, we compute the algal cultivation area required to recycle P in N-limited grid cells, and to recycle N in P-limited grid cells, summing these areas over each basin. We assume equatorial productivity 9.1 \'d7 10^1t ha-1 yr-1 (4.1 \'d7 10^1 T ac-1 yr-1), and at 40\'b0, at 5.5 \'d7 10^1 t ha-1 yr-1 (2.5 \'d7 10^1 T ac-1 yr-1). Globally, 8 \'d7 10^6 ha (3.6 \'d7 10^6 ac) of algal cultivation area is required for complete N and P recycling, with 6.4 \'d7 10^6ha (2.9 \'d7 10^6 ac) required in N-limited grid cells and 1.6 \'d7 10^6 ha (7.2 \'d7 10^5 ac) required in P-limited grid cells. For nutrient recycling in the major basins curated in the GRDC data sets, a total of 3.8e+07 ha (9.4e+07 ac) is required, with 3.4e+07 ha (8.4e+07 ac) in N-limited basins and 2800000 ha (6900000 ac) in P-limited basins (Figure 4B). The total biomass, 3.1e+12 kg yr-1, is less than a thousandth of a percent of world net primary productivity, and approximately three hundredths of a percent of world agriculture. The mean productivity of all grid cells is 64 t ha-1 yr-1 (2.3 \'d7 106 T ac-1 yr-1).\
