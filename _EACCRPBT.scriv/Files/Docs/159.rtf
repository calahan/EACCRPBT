\f0\fs32 \cf0 Globally, excess N and P applied to the 140 crops curated in the EarthStat datasets \{West et al., 2014, #62583\} total 5 \'d7 10^7 t (5.5 \'d7 10^7 T) and 9.1 \'d7 10^6 t (1 \'d7 10^7 T), respectively. We abbreviate metric tons with 't' and US tons with 'T'. Related to the Redfield ratios, these excesses imply N-limitation in 405,453 grid cells and P-limitation in293,335 grid cells (Figure 4A). As complete recycling of a limiting nutrient in a given grid cell or basin would leave an excess of the non-limiting nutrient, we compute the algal cultivation area required to recycle P in N-limited grid cells, and to recycle N in P-limited grid cells, summing these areas over each basin. We assume equatorial productivity 9.1 \'d7 10^1t ha-1 yr-1 (4.1 \'d7 10^1 T ac-1 yr-1), and at 40\'b0, at 5.5 \'d7 10^1 t ha-1 yr-1 (2.5 \'d7 10^1 T ac-1 yr-1). Globally, 1.9 \'d7 10^7 ha (8.3 \'d7 10^6 ac) of algal cultivation area is required for complete N and P recycling. For nutrient recycling in the major basins curated in the GRDC data set, a total of 1.4 \'d7 10^7ha (6.4 \'d7 10^6 ac) is required. The total biomass produced, 1.2 \'d7 10^9 t yr-1 (5.2 \'d7 10^8, 1.2% of world net primary productivity, or approximately 15% of world agriculture productivity.}
