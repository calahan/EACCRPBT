\f0\fs32 \cf0 Globally, excess N and P applied to the 140 crops curated in the EarthStat datasets \{West et al., 2014, #62583\} total 5 \'d7 10\super 7\nosupersub  t (5.5 \'d7 10\super 7\nosupersub  T) and 9.1 \'d7 10\super 6\nosupersub  t (1 \'d7 10\super 7\nosupersub  T), respectively. We abbreviate metric tons with 't' and US tons with 'T'. Related to the Redfield ratios, these excesses imply N-limitation in 405,453 grid cells and P-limitation in 293,335 grid cells (Figure 4A). As complete recycling of a limiting nutrient in a given grid cell or basin would leave an excess of the non-limiting nutrient, we compute the algal cultivation area required to recycle P in N-limited grid cells, and to recycle N in P-limited grid cells, summing these areas over each basin. We assume equatorial productivity 9.1 \'d7 10\super 1\nosupersub t ha\super -1\nosupersub  yr\super -1\nosupersub  (2.5 \'d7 10\super 2\nosupersub  T ac\super -1\nosupersub  yr\super -1\nosupersub ), and at 40\'b0, at 5.5 \'d7 10\super 1\nosupersub  t ha\super -1\nosupersub  yr\super -1\nosupersub  (1.5 \'d7 10\super 2\nosupersub  T ac\super -1\nosupersub  yr\super -1\nosupersub ). Globally, 1.9 \'d7 10\super 7\nosupersub  ha (5.1 \'d7 10\super 7\nosupersub  ac) of algal cultivation area is required for complete N and P recycling. For nutrient recycling in the major basins curated in the GRDC data set, a total of 1.4 \'d7 10\super 7\nosupersub  ha (3.9 \'d7 10\super 7\nosupersub  ac) is required. The total biomass produced, 1.2 \'d7 10\super 9\nosupersub  t yr\super -1\nosupersub  (3.2 \'d7 10\super 9\nosupersub  ac), 1.2% of world net primary productivity, or approximately 15% of world agriculture productivity.}
