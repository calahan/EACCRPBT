\f0\fs32 \cf0 The resource demands of Earth\'92s population, which may exceed eleven billion people by 2100 \{United\'a0Nations, 2017, #94734\}, will likely continue to intensify stresses on ecosystem services \{Boyd and Banzhaf, 2007, #49938; World Resources\'a0Institute, 2005, #12568\}. Among the most pressing threats is transgression of key planetary boundaries by overloading of the global N and P biogeochemical cycles via excess agricultural fertilizer/manure application and incompletely treated sewage \{Bouwman et al., 2005, #64003; Bouwman et al., 2013, #412; Boyer et al., 2006, #93219; Carpenter et al., 1998, #80361; MacDonald et al., 2011, #24675; Moe and Rheingans, 2006, #86296; Potter et al., 2010, #43603; Sims et al., 1998, #57108; Steffen et al., 2015, #78923 ;World and UNICEF, 2017, #51383\}. Fresh and marine waters receiving these excess nutrients are experiencing harmful algal blooms (HABs) and their concomitant negative effects on ecosystem and human health with increasing frequency and extent  \{Anderson et al., 2011, #64929; Fu et al., 2012, #46278; Glibert et al., 2005, #83785; Hallegraeff, 1993, #70258; Heisler et al., 2008, #9953\}.  Additionally, unsustainable fossil fuel extraction and combustion are overloading the global C biogeochemical cycle, warming our climate and acidifying our oceans \{Cai, 2003, #31497; Ciais et al., 2014, #20246; Mostofa et al., 2015, #46684; Pachauri et al., 2014, #63677; Prentice et al., 2001, #15935\}. Human activity and these biogeochemical cycles are tightly coupled with photosynthesis, as primary production fixes environmental C, N, and P into biomass\{Field et al., 1998, #18706\}. Thus if photosynthesis could be greatly expanded globally and the resulting biomass effectively managed, stresses on multiple Earth systems could be relieved. With a sufficiently large increase in primary production, negative impacts on N and P cycling could be stabilized and eventually reversed, with concomitant major relief of stress on C cycling.}
