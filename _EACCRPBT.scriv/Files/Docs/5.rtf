\f0\fs32 \cf0 The resource demands of Earth\'92s population, which may exceed eleven billion people by 2100 \{United\'a0Nations, 2017, #94734\}, will likely continue to intensify stresses on ecosystem services \{World Resources\'a0Institute, 2005, #12568; Boyd and Banzhaf, 2007, #49938\}. One of the most pressing threats is overloading of the global N and P biogeochemical cycles via excess agricultural fertilizer/manure application and incompletely treated sewage, a consequence of inadequate infrastructure investment \{Rockstr\'f6m et al., 2009, #94424; Steffen et al., 2015, #78923\}. The fresh and marine waters that receive these excess nutrients are experiencing an increase in the frequency and extent of harmful algal blooms (HABs), leading to larger, more frequent, and more persistent hypoxic dead zones, as well as increasing negative human health effects \{Hallegraeff, 1993, #70258; Heisler et al., 2008, #9953\}.  Additionally, unsustainable fossil fuel extraction and combustion are overloading the global C biogeochemical cycle, warming our climate  and acidifying our oceans \{Pachauri et al., 2014, #63677; Mostofa et al., 2015, #46684\}. Human activity and biogeochemical cycles are tightly coupled with photosynthesis, as primary production fixes environmental C, N, and P into biomass. Thus if photosynthesis could be greatly expanded on a global scale and the resulting biomass effectively managed, stresses on multiple Earth systems could be relieved. With sufficiently large increases in primary production, negative impacts on N and P cycling could be stabilized and eventually reversed, with concomitant major relief of stress on C cycling.}
