\f0\fs32 \cf0 The resource demands of Earth\'92s population, which may exceed eleven billion people by 2100 \{United\'a0Nations, 2015, #94734\}, will likely continue to intensify stresses on ecosystem services \{Boyd and Banzhaf, 2007, #49938\}. Excess agricultural fertilizer/manure application, upon which high-performance agriculture depends, and incompletely treated sewage, a consequence of inadequate infrastructure investment, are overloading the biogeochemical N and P cycles, one of the most pressing threats \{Steffen et al., 2015, #78923; Rockstr\'f6m et al., 2009, #94424\}. The fresh and marine waters that receive these excess nutrients are experiencing an increase in the frequency and extent of harmful algal blooms (HABs), leading to larger, more frequent, and more persistent hypoxic dead zones, as well as increasing negative human health effects \{Hallegraeff, 1993, #70258; Heisler et al., 2008, #9953\}. Additionally, unsustainable fossil fuel extraction and combustion are overloading the C cycle, warming our climate \{Pachauri et al., 2014, #63677\} and acidifying our oceans \{Mostofa et al., 2015, #46684\}. Human activity, biogeochemical cycles, and photosynthesis are tightly coupled, as primary production fixes environmental C, N, and P into biomass. If photosynthesis could be greatly expanded on a global scale, and the resulting biomass effectively managed, stresses on multiple Earth systems could be slowed, and in the case of N and P, stabilized and reversed.}
