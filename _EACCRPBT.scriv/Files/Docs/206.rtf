\f0\fs32 \cf0 Our economic model for N and P recycling assumes continued application of excess agricultural nutrients at the current rate. Our worst and best case scenarios bracket a range of potential capital and operational expenses, determined by floway cost and lifetime (CapEx), and operator salary (OpEx). We adopt a simple investment scenario starting with an initial annual spending rate (best case: $6.9 \'d7 10\super 7\nosupersub  yr\super -1\nosupersub ; worst case: $1.9 \'d7 10\super 8\nosupersub  yr\super -1\nosupersub ), that increases by 10% each year for 100 years, then remains at that level (best case: $8.7 \'d7 10\super 11\nosupersub  yr-1; worst case: $2.3 \'d7 10\super 12\nosupersub  yr\super -1\nosupersub ) for the next 100 years, setting the initial spending at a level that results in complete nutrient recycling after year 1 \'d7 10\super 2\nosupersub  (Table 3, Figure 5). This exponential spending increase, combined with the limited lifetime of an ATS facility produces the \'93ringing\'94 phenomenon apparent in the plots of biomass production, while the sudden halt to investment growth at year 100 results in an apparent discontinuity apparent as a change in slope of biomass production. We apply the same tactic to estimate the effort needed to recycle net anthropogenic C, finding the initial investment rate (best case: $7.1 \'d7 10\super 8\nosupersub  yr\super -1\nosupersub ; worst case: $1.9 \'d7 10\super 9\nosupersub  yr\super -1\nosupersub ) and final investment rate (best case: $8.9 \'d7 10\super 12\nosupersub  yr\super -1\nosupersub ; worst case: $2.4 \'d7 10\super 13\nosupersub  yr\super -1\nosupersub ) to be an order of magnitude greater than for N and P recycling.}
