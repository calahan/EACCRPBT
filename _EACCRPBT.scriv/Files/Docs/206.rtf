\f0\fs32 \cf0 To estimate an upper limit to the gross expenses required to implement global N and P recycling, we assume worse case CaEx, and OpEx, a relatively short floway lifespan, unexceptional algal productivity (Table 3), and no future reductions in excess C, N, and P. We adopt an investment scenario starting with an initial annual spending rate that increases by a fixed percentage each year for 100 years (Table 4, Figs. 4A, 4C), then remains at that level for the next 100 years, setting the initial spending at a level that results in complete recycling at year 100. This exponential spending increase combined with the limited lifetime of an ATS facility produces the \'93ringing\'94 phenomenon apparent in biomass production (Figs. 4B, 4C). Our parameters insure that once the spending rate becomes constant, the total operational area is never below the minimum needed to achieve the required recycling. In our worse case scenario for N and P recycling, spending begins at $4.9 \'d7 10\super 8\nosupersub  yr\super -1\nosupersub and grows to $6.1 \'d7 10\super 12\nosupersub  yr\super -1\nosupersub . In our better case scenario, spending begins at $1.8 \'d7 10\super 8\nosupersub  yr\super -1\nosupersub and grows to $2.3 \'d7 10\super 12\nosupersub  yr\super -1\nosupersub .}
