\f0\fs32 \cf0 Technically, global recycling of N and P pollution arising from agriculture can be accomplished with expanded algae cultivation using ATS. The capital and operational investments required are large but tractable, but additional rewards would likely accrue through improving the global ecological situation. The primary difficulties are probably not technological, but rather both sociopolitical, with pluralities ever reluctant to address affronts for which they are collectively responsible, and macroeconomic, with such a large injection of biomass into world trade likely to prompt resistance from entities having a vested interest in the status quo. While an independent market for the enormous annual biomass production required for N and P recycling may not develop immediately, bounties for N and P capture, as well as for the associated C capture, are one way to pay for establishment and operation of a growing algal cultivation infrastructure. If biofuels or other commodities can be profitably manufactured from this algal biomass, subsidies can eventually be reduced or eliminated. One of the most cost-effective and beneficial uses for algal biomass may be returning it to local land as a soil amendment and fertilizer, potentially slowing or reversing the loss of arable land, delaying peak phosphorus, and reducing the energy and materials expended on manufacture of N fertilizer. This potential biomass sink very deep, likely able to accept biomass for at least as long as soil depletion has been occurring, with further agriculture and aquaculture applications also demonstrated. While additional efforts to either reduce application or reclaim excesses of nutrients may also be implemented, to date none of these appear as promising as algal turf scrubbing for global deployment.}
