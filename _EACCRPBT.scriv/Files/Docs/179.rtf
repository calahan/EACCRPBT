\f0\fs32 \cf0 The scale of our proposed intervention prompts concerns about environmental impacts. For example, algal biomass that concentrate toxins from polluted water may itself become toxic waste, requiring treatment to accommodate further uses. With landfilling the default fate of biomass for current production units, uses that both generate revenue and lower residue volume can improve the economics. Biofuel production could remove up to one third of the biomass as carbon, concentrating toxins in the residue thus reducing landfill and transportation costs. Another possible impact is emissions from floways. Oxygen will be released during photosynthesis, both into the atmosphere and dissolved in the outflow, likely benefitting downstream ecosystems but also associated with increased pH potentially requiring partial neutralization. Many marine algae emit dimethyl sulfide (DMS), a volatile organosulfur compound that impacts climate by nucleating clouds over the oceans \{Charlson et al., 1987, #54604\}. No studies of DMS emissions from ATS floways have yet been performed. Increased cloud cover could increase Earth\'92s albedo, slowing global warming, but could also reduce agricultural and photovoltaic productivity. Other impacts that merit consideration relate to the algal cultivation area required. While algal floways are efficient at non-point nutrient removal on an areal basis, they nevertheless require conversion of land from current uses to algae cultivation. Non-agricultural land, brownfields, or even building roofs might be candidates for conversion, but where agriculture is most concentrated, existing crop production might have to be traded for algae production, requiring careful cost-benefit analysis. Wading birds are frequently observed in production floways, feeding on productivity-inhibiting algal grazers and adding additional nutrients to the water. This phenomenon will recur and increase with expanded algal cultivation, potentially affecting migration and transporting algal cells between ecosystems. These examples represent questions that will need to be investigated as algae cultivation expands from the few hectares now in production to the tens of millions of hectares needed.}
