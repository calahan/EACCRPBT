Figure 5. Gross expense and biomass production for recycling N/P and C. Two scenarios are illustrated: High CapEx/OpEx with a 20 year floway life expectancy (worse case; \'93hi hi lo\'94), and low CapEx/OpEx with a 40 year floway life expectancy (better case; \'93lo lo hi\'94). (A) Worse and better cases for N/P recycling eventually require spending $6.1 trillion and $2.3 trillion annually, respectively. (B) N/P recycling produces 3.1 \'d7 10\super 9\nosupersub  t yr\super -1\nosupersub  algal biomass. (C) Worse and better cases for C recycling require eventually spending $43 trillion and $16 trillion annually, respectively. (D) C recycling produces, at minimum, 2.2 \'d7 10\super 10\nosupersub  t yr\super -1\nosupersub  algal biomass. (C and D) N and P recycling included for scale.}
