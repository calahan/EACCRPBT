\f0\fs32 \cf0 Because so much investment is required for complete N and P recycling, let alone C recycling, it may be prudent to start with projects of a scale affording early and definitive measures of success. The current global ecological situation derives from centuries of increasing human impact on ecosystem services. Centuries of increasing countermeasures might be required to completely reverse the damage. Initially, only local effects will be easily discernible, so focusing most of the initial investment on several smaller, less polluted basins, or on a few high priority basins, might be needed to deliver improvements as rapidly and visibly as feasible. Beyond water and biomass quality measurements themselves, initial measures of success could include reduction in the frequency, duration, and extent of HABs within the affected waters, improved health of reef and other ecologies in the estuaries and bays receiving the discharge, and improved agricultural metrics where algal biomass is applied to the soil. A preliminary project to completely treat a small basin could be mounted at considerably lower cost than that for our proposed global intervention.}
