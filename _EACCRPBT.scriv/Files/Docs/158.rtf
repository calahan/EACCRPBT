\f0\fs32 \cf0 Here we illustrate the contribution of global agriculture to impending transgressions of planetary boundaries involving biogeochemical cycling (Fig. 2A-B) \{Steffen et al., 2015, #78923\}, and estimate the magnitude of the investment required to counteract these transgressions using benthic algal cultivation implemented by ATS. If effect we are modeling a return to pre-industrial conditions of all freshwater drainage. Such a complete effort may not be strictly necessary, but this conservative stance allows us to determine an upper limit on the required effort, demonstrating that even under worse-case assumptions our project is achievable. Thus we assume modest biomass productivity and include relatively high capital and operating expenses. We extend our analysis to the much larger and perhaps more speculative goal of stabilizing net anthropogenic C, partly to establish a scale of comparison, and partly to show that it is not inconceivable to at least partially manage C cycling through algal cultivation as well. To the extent that future efforts to curb anthropogenic C emissions succeed, the algal cultivation area needed to help manage this pollutant will also be reduced.}
