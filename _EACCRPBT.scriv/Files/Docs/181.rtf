\f0\fs32 \cf0 Values for economic parameters were chosen to represent best and worst cases for CapEx, OpEx and facility lifetime (Table 3). The economic model creates an R data frame by populating the first row (year 1) with initial conditions then applies the model\'92s spending growth formula to that row to produce the next row (year 2), repeating for year 3 to year 100. The model\'92s constant spending formula is then applied similarly for the following hundred years. To determine the initial rate, we chose parameters such that the minimum algal biomass is always at least sufficient to completely recycle the relevant nutrient(s).}
