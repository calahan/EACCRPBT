\f0\fs32 \cf0 Where concentrated pollutants are released, as from sewage treatment plants or factories, effective industrial treatment is feasible but expensive, and is actively, if sporadically, performed mostly in wealthy countries \{Elimelech, 2006, #46773; Environmental Protection Agency, 2007, #89392; H\'f8ibye et al., 2008, #64492; H\'f8ibye et al., 2008, #64492\}. However, even with cleanup of concentrated N and P via expanded industrial treatment \{Ribaudo et al., 2001, #100325\}, agriculture unavoidably produces global nonpoint N and P pollution from application of fertilizer and manure that infiltrates nearby surface and subsurface waters, with septic systems and cesspools contributing additional N and P in much of the world \{Cairncross, 2003, #94435\}. Beyond cleanup of excess N and P, CO\sub 2\nosupersub -specific solutions that compress or chemically fix this pollutant from industrial facilities have poor economics and depend on storage in sites of uncertain stability \{Cu\'e9llar-Franca and Azapagic, 2015, #17420\}\{Esteves and Morgado, 2012, #55792\}. Fortifying the oceans with limiting nutrients such as iron could remove large quantities of nutrients \{Boyd et al., 2007, #54273; Buesseler et al., 2008, #24311; Naqvi and Smetacek, 2011, #29270\} by stimulating large plankton blooms that then sink, but the long-term impacts of this approach are poorly understood, and the loss of potentially valuable biomass weakens the economics. It is essential to seek more affordable and effective solutions.}
