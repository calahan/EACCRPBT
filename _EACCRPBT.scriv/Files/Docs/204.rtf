\f0\fs32 \cf0 Our approach suffers from several limitations. Because we approximate the effort needed to globally recycle pollutants, rather than create a detailed simulation, we chose a round number (100 years) for our project duration, and a simple algorithm for spending: exponential growth starting at a defined spending rate and ending at a level that satisfies the pollutant recycling rate. This approach to financing and schedule is rudimentary, but the large scale of our proposed intervention makes it practically impossible to incorporate all the different financing, permitting, sociopolitical situations affecting jurisdictions of interest. Our linear model relating latitude to productivity ignores climatic differences along latitude lines, and can only be corrected by a comprehensive set of pilot studies. The eventual costs for N and P recycling are a substantial percentage of the gross world product, suggesting that the commodity flow of algal biomass will affect markets for other commodities, but we do not address these impacts. The basin component of our analysis focuses on 405 curated basins. A more comprehensive analysis would consider the remaining basins, but visual inspection of Figures 2C and 2D suggests that our prioritization would be little changed, especially in the highest priority range. Visual inspection of Figures 2A-2C also reveals patterns of lacunae (for example an approximately Arizona-shaped void in western North America) suggesting that the nutrient data is also incomplete. However, even if formally incomplete, the coverage is nevertheless sufficiently extensive that our main conclusions would also likely be little changed with more complete data.\
