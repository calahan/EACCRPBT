\f0\fs32 \cf0 To identify the limiting nutrient for each grid cell with excess nutrients, we obtained mass ratios for the nutrients C, N, and P by converting their stoichiometric Redfield ratios into mass ratios (R\sub C\nosupersub , R\sub N\nosupersub , and R\sub P\nosupersub  respectively), and obtained the Redfield P/N mass ratio, R\sub PN\nosupersub  = R\sub P\nosupersub /R\sub N\nosupersub . Then for each grid cell we divided the excess P mass by the excess N mass to obtain its P/N mass ratio, GC\sub PN\nosupersub , and compared this value to R\sub PN\nosupersub , with locations having R\sub PN\nosupersub  < GC\sub PN\nosupersub  considered P limited and locations having R\sub PN\nosupersub  \uc0\u8805  GC\sub PN\nosupersub  considered N limited. To determine the amount of algal biomass needed to incorporate the non-limiting nutrient for each grid cell, GC\sub BM\nosupersub , we divided that grid cell\'92s excess mass of the nutrient, M\sub Nut\nosupersub , by R\sub N\nosupersub  or R\sub P\nosupersub  , depending on the identity of the nutrient, B\sub gc\nosupersub  = M\sub Nut\nosupersub /R\sub Nut\nosupersub . To determine the algal cultivation area needed to produce the required amount of biomass for each location, we modeled algal productivity as a linear function of latitude, with each grid cell considered as a trapezoid centered on its associated coordinates. To rank basins by investment required to recycle nutrient excesses, we then summed the algal growth area for each location contained by each basin.}
