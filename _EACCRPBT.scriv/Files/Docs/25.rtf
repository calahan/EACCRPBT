\f0\fs32 \cf0 To identify the limiting nutrient for each location with excess nutrients, its P/N mass ratio, R\sub PN\nosupersub  was determined and compared to the P/N mass ratio of biomass computed from the Redfield ratios, R\sub R\nosupersub  = 0.0625, with locations having R\sub PN\nosupersub  < R\sub R\nosupersub  considered P limited and locations having R\sub PN\nosupersub  \uc0\u8805  R\sub R\nosupersub  considered N limited. To determine the amount of algal biomass needed to incorporate the non-limiting nutrient for each location, B\sub LOC\nosupersub , we divided the excess of that nutrient, E\sub N\nosupersub , in t yr\super -1\nosupersub , by the Redfield ratio for that nutrient R\sub N\nosupersub , B\sub LOC\nosupersub  = E\sub N\nosupersub /R\sub N\nosupersub .  To determine the algal cultivation area needed to produce the required amount of biomass for each location, we modeled algal productivity as a linear function of latitude, L\sub LOC\nosupersub , in degrees, P\sub LOC\nosupersub  = -0.91 t ha\super -1\nosupersub  yr-1 \'d7 L\sub LOC\nosupersub  + 91t ha\super -1\nosupersub  yr\super -1\nosupersub , and modeled the area of each location, A\sub LOC\nosupersub , by considering it as a trapezoid centered on its associated coordinates, then divided the required biomass by P\sub LOC\nosupersub . To rank basins by investment required to recycle nutrient excesses, we then summed the algal growth area for each location contained by each basin.}
