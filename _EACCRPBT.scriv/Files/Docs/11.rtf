\f0\fs32 \cf0 Humanity is degrading multiple ecosystem services, potentially irreversibly. Two of the most important human impacts appear to be excess agricultural nutrient loading in our fresh and estuarine waters and excess carbon dioxide in our oceans and atmosphere. Global large-scale intervention is required to slow, halt, and eventually reverse these stresses. Cultivating benthic polyculture algae within controlled open-field photobioreactors is a practical technique for exploiting the ubiquity and high productivity of algae, to capture and recycle the pollutants driving humanity across the safe boundaries of biogeochemical cycling, ocean acidification, and global warming. Expanded globally, algae cultivation could recycle all excess N and P, while simultaneously sequestering appreciable excess carbon. While obviously a major capital and operational investment, such an algal recycling project is comparable in magnitude to the construction and maintenance of the global road transportation network. Beyond direct amelioration of critical threats expanded algal cultivation would produce a major new commodity flow of biomass, and because of coupling among Earth systems, would additionally help relieve other stresses. }
