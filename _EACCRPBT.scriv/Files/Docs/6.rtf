\f0\fs32 \cf0 As C, N, and P cycle globally, and their chemical compounds become dilute and pervasive once released into the environment, projects to appreciably sequester or recycle them must be globally distributed at large scale. One practice intended to mitigate dilute N and P pollution is the constructed treatment wetland (CTW) \{Hoffmann et al., 2011, #95223; Kivaisi, 2001, #28974; Vymazal, 2010, #45132\}. CTWs embed some excess P in the soil while volatilizing much of the excess N, and to a lesser extent sequester these nutrients as biomass, with effective P removal requiring increased complexity and expense \{Vymazal, 2010, #45132; Fasching et al., 2015, #79924\}. Due to linkage with photosynthesis, CTWs also sequester some C in biomass. While low operating costs are claimed for CTWs, these estimates have not generally included long term harvesting to counter maturation and degradation \{Keller and Knight, 2004, #5792\}; a 20-30 yr harvest cycle requires major expense for dredging, transportation and sequestering or processing the spoil. Further advantages ascribed to CTWs include increased biodiversity, mitigation of pathogens and additional pollutants, and applicability over a range of geographical, climatic, and socio-economic environments \{Semeraro et al., 2015, #92954; Kivaisi, 2001, #28974\}. However, the areal effectiveness of CTW nutrient removal tends to be so low that treating an agricultural basin to pre-industrial levels of N and P with would require converting a substantial proportion of a basin, possibly including crop growth area, to wetlands (See

The floating treatment wetland (FTW), an aquatic analog of CTWs, imposes additional operational burdens, is potentially viable only in relatively calm waters - greatly limiting its applicability - and can increase, rather than decrease, nutrient loading if not managed properly \{Stewart et al., 2008, #29842; Wang and Sample, 2014, #10440; Winston et al., 2013, #66703\}. If expanded to a size functional for treating a major lake or estuary, a FTW would likely interfere with other commercial and recreational uses.}
