Figure 2. Global distribution of nutrient excesses and deficits. Gray color indicates no nutrient data. (A) N excess. Red shades indicate grid cells with the largest excesses, representing 10% of the total; yellow-to-orange shades indicate grid cells responsible for the next-highest 40% of total excess; green shades represent the lowest 50%. (B) P excess. Coloring scheme is as in A, but with the addition of darker green indicating grid cells with P deficit. (C) Combined N and P excess, coloring scheme as in A. (D) Ranking 405 major basins by summing the nutrient excesses of the grid cells belonging to each basin; coloring scheme as in A.}
