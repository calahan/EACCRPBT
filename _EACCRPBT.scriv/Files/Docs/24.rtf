\f0\fs32 \cf0 We assume biomass mass ratios of 0.36, 0.063,  and 0.0087 for C, N and P respectively, derived from stoichiometric ratios of algal biomass \{Ebeling et al., 2006, #88379\}. CapEx and OpEx estimates are derived from HydroMentia reports. Values for economic parameters were chosen to represent best and worst cases for CapEx (250000 and 1e+06 $ ha-1 respectively)OpEx (33000 and 70000$ ha-1 yr-1 respectively) and facility lifetime (20 yr for low CapEx and 40 yr for high Capex). Best and worst case OpeEx values were chosen to reflect fully encumbered lower and higher end middle-class salaries in the US and additional operational costs of 10% of CapEx (Table 3). The economic model creates an R data frame by populating the first row (year 1) with initial conditions then applies the model\'92s spending growth formula, (0.1% yr-1), to that row to produce the next row (year 2), repeating the procedure for year 3 to year 50 . Constant spending formula is then applied similarly for the following 50 yr. To determine the initial rate, we chose parameters such that once fully built out, the minimum algal biomass is always sufficient to completely recycle the relevant nutrient(s).}
