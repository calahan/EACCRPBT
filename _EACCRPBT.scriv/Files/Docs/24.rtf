\f0\fs32 \cf0 We assume biomass mass ratios of 36%, 6.3%, and 0.87% for C, N and P respectively, derived from the stoichiometric ratios of algal biomass \{Ebeling et al., 2006, #88379; Hillebrand and Sommer, 1999, #12928\}. CapEx and OpEx estimates are ultimately derived from actual construction and operation figures \{Hoffman et al., 2017, #34706\}. Values for economic parameters were chosen to represent best and worst cases for CapEx ($2.5 \'d7 10\super 5\nosupersub  ha\super -1\nosupersub  ($1.0 \'d7 10\super 5\nosupersub  ac\super -1\nosupersub ) and $1.0 \'d7 10\super 6\nosupersub  $ ha\super -1\nosupersub  ($4.0 \'d7 10\super 5\nosupersub  ac\super -1\nosupersub  respectively)), OpEx ($3.3 \'d7 10\super 4\nosupersub  ha\super -1\nosupersub  ($1.3 \'d7 10\super 4\nosupersub  ac\super -1\nosupersub ) and $7 \'d7 10\super 4\nosupersub  ha\super -1\nosupersub  yr\super -1\nosupersub  ($2.8 \'d7 10\super 4\nosupersub  ac\super -1\nosupersub ) respectively)) and facility lifetime (20 yr for low CapEx and 40 yr for high Capex, respectively). Best and worst case OpEx values were chosen to represent fully encumbered lower and higher end middle-class salaries in the US and additional operational costs of 10% of CapEx (Table 3). The economic model creates an R data frame by populating the first row (year 1) with initial conditions then applies the model\'92s spending growth formula (10% yr\super -1\nosupersub ), to that row to produce the next row (year 2), repeating the procedure for year 3 to year 100 . Constant spending is then applied similarly for the following 100 yr. To determine the initial spending rate, we chose parameters such that once the system is fully built out, the minimum algal biomass is always sufficient to completely recycle the relevant nutrients.}
