\f0\fs32 \cf0 Figure and model parameters are stored in the Excel workbook EACCRPBT.xlsx and imported as variables into the R code used to generate figures and tables. We assume AFDW biomass mass ratios of 0.5, 0.048, and 0.0030 for C, N and P respectively, derived from analysis of algal biomass \{Vardon et al., 2012, #78258\} and the Redfield atomic ratios \{Hillebrand and Sommer, 1999, #12928\}. CapEx and OpEx estimates are derived from HydroMentia reports.}
