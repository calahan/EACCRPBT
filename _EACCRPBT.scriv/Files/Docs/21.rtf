\f0\fs32 \cf0 If globally distributed throughout the world\'92s river basins at large enough scale, ATS could directly reverse the transgressions of planetary boundaries \{Steffen et al., 2015, #78923\} involving N and P cycling. Here we estimate the scope of such an intervention both from a global perspective and by prioritizing some of the 405 major hydrological basins, based on publicly available nutrient and geospatial datasets. We discuss potential issues with land availability, CapEx and OpEx, and sociopolitical considerations, ultimately extrapolating our analysis to complete recycling of net anthropogenic carbon. Our stance is conservative, as our intent is to determine an approximate upper limit to the effort needed to counteract these global threats. Improvements in biomass productivity and reduction in costs, reduce the CapEx and OpEx needed for our proposed intervention. Improving our model\'92s accuracy and precision will require a multi-year global program of building and operating ATS pilot projects, affording development of a predictive productivity model and providing a more extensive knowledge base specific regional characteristics.}
