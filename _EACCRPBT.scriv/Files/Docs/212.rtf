\f0\fs32 \cf0 During photosynthesis, a floway\'92s oxygen concentration rises while carbon fixation drives the carbonate/bicarbonate buffer system towards its higher-pH, carbonate dominated profile, further upgrading the water beyond merely cleaning it of pollutants, if it can be mixed with \'93acidified\'94 water whose pH is too low. Where the water is high in nutrient pollution, the floway can become carbon limited, reaching a pH of 9.5 or higher and allowing phosphate salts to precipitate. Carbon limitation is accompanied by a reduction in productivity, but sparging CO\sub 2\nosupersub  into the water at intervals along the floway can reverse the pH rise and productivity decline. These considerations suggest design and management options that can be optimized for specific situations. For N-limited basins, a subset of the floway area can be operated for P recovery by using relatively long floways (up to 300 m (980 ft)) without CO\sub 2\nosupersub  sparging, with the precipitate recovered as high-P biomass. For P limited basins, there is no correspondingly simple operation to precipitate surplus N-containing salts. However, again a subset of the floways can be operated for P precipitation, with the recovered P recycled into floways with surplus N rather than landfilled or further processed.}
