\f0\fs32 \cf0 Nutrient data \{Potter et al., 2010, #43603\} are organized on a 0.5\'92 \'d7 0.5\'92 grid of latitude and longitude, with 9,318,244 total grid cells, 698,788 having N and P data and 228,398 having P data only (Fig. 2). Values represent kg of excess nutrient per grid cell, and are positive for N but positive or negative for P. We consider only positive values, as nutrient deficits are not transferrable among grid cells or basins. Excess N per grid cell ranges from 0 kg to 2.8 \'d7 10^6 kg. Excess P per grid cell ranges from 0 kg to 5.8 \'d7 10^5 kg. Half of the excess N and P is accounted for by 6.8% and 7.0% of their respective grid cells. The 405 major basins curated by the Global Runoff Data Center \{Global Runoff Data Centre, 2007, #36285\} are responsible for 77% of global nutrient excess, for both N and P (Tables 1, A1). Excess N per curated basin ranges from 0 to 5.1 \'d7 10^9 kg yr-1. Excess P per basin ranges from 0 kg yr-1 to 1 \'d7 10^9 kg yr-1. Half of the nutrient excess is contributed by five (N) or six (P) basins (Table 1). The Yangze contributes the most N, while the Ganges contributes the most P.}
