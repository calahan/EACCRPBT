\f0\fs32 \cf0 Data Processing: Data processing was organized using R Studio 1.0.143 \{RStudio\'a0Team, 2016, #53167\}, integrating R 3.4.2\{R\'a0Core\'a0Team, 2015, #89220\} and various R packages; source code and instructions for reproducing our findings are available at http://github.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://github/calahan/EACCRPBT"}}{\fldrslt com}}/calahan/EACCRPBT and http://github.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://github/calahan/Calahanlab"}}{\fldrslt com}}/calahan/Calahanlab. Model parameters were organized in the spreadsheet EACCRPBT.xlsx and imported as variables into the R code used to generate figures and tables. Datasets were obtained from NaturalEarth (continents) \{Natural\'a0Earth, 2015, #75070\}, the Global Runoff Data Center (GRDC) (basins, lakes, and rivers) \{Global\'a0Runoff\'a0Data\'a0Centre, 2007, #36285; Global\'a0Runoff\'a0Data\'a0Centre, 2007, #86930\}, and EarthStat (N and P nutrient loading) \{West et al., 2014, #62583\} (obtaining GRDC data requires completing an application form). An 8 GB Apple MacBook Pro/2.5 GHz Intel Core i5 running OS X 10.11.6 was used for all data processing.}
