\f0\fs32 \cf0 Here we evaluate the capability of the algae cultivation practice known as algal turf scrubbing (ATS) \{Stewart, 2004, #96157; Adey et al., 2011, #74672\} to intervene in humanity\'92s overloading of the N, P, and C biogeochemical cycles. One of us (Adey) is the inventor of this process, a reliable technology that harnesses rapidly growing benthic algal polycultures, also known as periphyton, confined within an open-field photobioreactor, to photosynthetically remove N, P, C, and other aquatic pollutants from point and nonpoint fresh and marine waters \{Adey et al., 1996, #59863;tRothman et al., 2013, #23278\}, simultaneously oxygenating the cleaned effluent, increasing its pH, and producing copious biomass (ATS is a trademark, and Algal Turf Scrubber a registered trademark, of Ecological Systems Inc., the primary R&D entity for the technology; these are licensed to HydroMentia Technologies LLC). ATS has been deployed at hectare scale for decades, with low capital and operational costs compared to other nonpoint treatment solutions, demonstrating reliable operation and productivity equal to or better than local high-performance agriculture. ATS introduces what is essentially a new agricultural crop, nonspecific algal biomass, low in water consumption and independent of the extractive industries producing fertilizer and other commodities essential for the highest agricultural productivities. ATS has been demonstrated at more than forty locations for polishing water from secondary sewage treatment, treating raw and digested animal manure, recycling aquaculture/mariculture wastewater, removing nutrients from dredge spoil, and cleaning agricultural runoff (Fig. 1E, Table 1). Mean annual ash-free dry weight (AFDW) productivity in temperate and sub-tropical zones routinely exceeds 55 t ha\super -1\nosupersub  yr\super -1\nosupersub  (20 ton ac\super -1\nosupersub  yr\super -1\nosupersub ); recent work supports the likelihood of increasing productivity, with annual AFDW means of 150 t ha\super -1\nosupersub  yr\super -1\nosupersub  (54 ton ac\super -1\nosupersub  yr\super -1\nosupersub ) published \{Adey et al., 2013, #773\}.}
