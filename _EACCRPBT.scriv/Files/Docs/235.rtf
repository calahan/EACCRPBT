\f0\fs32 \cf0 Nutrient data \{Potter et al., 2010, #43603\} are organized on a 0.5\'92 \'d7 0.5\'92 grid of latitude and longitude, with 9,318,244 total locations, 698,788 having N and P data and 927,186 having P data (Fig. 2). Values represent kilograms of excess nutrient per cell, and are positive for N but positive or negative for P. We consider only positive values, as nutrient deficits are not transferrable among locations or basins. Excess N and P total # kg and # kg, respectively. Excess N per grid cell ranges from 3.9 \'d7 10\super -6\nosupersub  kg to 2.8 \'d7 10\super 6\nosupersub  kg. Excess P per cell ranges from

\f0 1.8 \'d7 10\super 5\nosupersub  kg to 5.8 \'d7 10\super 5\nosupersub  kg \{West et al., 2014, #62583\}. Half of the excess N and P is accounted for by 6.8% and 7.0% of their respective locations. The 405 major basins curated by the Global Runoff Data Center are responsible for 77% of global nutrient excess, for both N and P (Table A1). Excess N per curated basin ranges from 0 to 5.1 \'d7 10\super 9\nosupersub  kg yr\super -1\nosupersub . Excess P per basin ranges from

\f0 6.8 \'d7 10\super 7\nosupersub  kg yr\super -1\nosupersub  to 1.0 \'d7 10\super 9\nosupersub  kg yr\super -1\nosupersub . Half of the nutrient excess is contributed by five (N) or six (P) basins (Table 1). The Yangze contributes the most N (5.1 \'d7 10\super 9\nosupersub  kg yr\super -1\nosupersub ), while the Ganges contributes the most P (1.0 \'d7 10\super 9\nosupersub  kg yr\super -1\nosupersub ).}
