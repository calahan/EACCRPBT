\f0\fs32 \cf0 Because the effectiveness of an ATS facility at removing N and P pollution correlates with its biomass productivity, the fate of the biomass is an essential consideration for project planning, ideally producing revenue to help offset treatment costs. Biomass produced from waters with low toxin concentrations toxins could be used in agriculture as a fertilizer/soil amendment \{Mulbry et al., 2005, #24501\}, as a source of compost \{Shiralipour and Epstein, 2005, #22388\}, or as an animal or fish feed\{Adey and Purgason, 1998, #21268; Adey and Purgason, 1998, #27927\}. Modern high-intensity agriculture has a negative side effect of degrading agricultural land; some estimates suggest that more than one third of originally arable land has been degraded by human impacts \{Oldeman, 1994, #97184\}. Returning organic carbon and nutrients from algal biomass to degraded agricultural land can potentially slow or reverse this trend, providing both food security and a sink for algal biomass. Biomass whose toxin concentration is unacceptable for agriculture or aquaculture must be processed to improve its quality if intended for food production, used for producing biofuels, other commodities, or higher value products, or landfilled, with any toxic residues from further processing either landfilled or recycled. }
