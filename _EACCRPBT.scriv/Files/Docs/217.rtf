Figure 4. Limiting nutrient and algal cultivation required for nutrient recycling. (A) Nutrient limitation of grid cells based on the mass ratio N:P. Cells with N:P <= 16 are N limited and colored blue. Cells with N:P >16 are P limited and colored orange. (B) Nutrient excesses were summed for each basin and the N:P ratio of the sums were computed; color scheme as in (A). (C) Grid cells ranked by algal cultivation area required to recycle each grid cell\'92s limiting nutrient, red cells indicating the 10% requiring the highest cultivation area, yellow the next 40%, and red the lowest 50%. (D) Basins ranked by algal cultivation area required to recycle each basin\'92s limiting nutrient, color scheme as in C.}
