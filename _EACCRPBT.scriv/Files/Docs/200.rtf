Figure 1. Algal Turf Scrubbing (ATS). (A) Aerial view of a ~1 ha (~2.5 ac) system in Florida. Water surges onto the floway along the upper contour, whose extrema are indicated by large white arrows. Piles of dewatered (~8% solids) harvested biomass are indicated by small white arrows. Small black arrow indicates a sump into which biomass is scraped. (B) Harvesting using a small agriculture vehicle equipped with a scraper. Scraped material is pushed into a the sump indicated by the solid arrow in A. Note input surger (white arrow). (C) Person\'92s-eye view of algal biomass ready for harvest. (D) Collecting gravity-dewatered harvest from sump using a motorized rake. (E) Locations of past and present outdoor ATS pilot projects (small circles) and production systems (large circles).}
