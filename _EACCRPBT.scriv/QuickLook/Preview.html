<p class="binderItem"><strong>Abstract</strong><br/>Humanity is degrading multiple ecosystem services, potentially irreversibly. Two of the most important human impacts appear to be excess agricultural nutrient loading in our fresh and estuarine waters and excess carbon dioxide in our oceans and atmosphere. Large-scale global intervention is required to slow, halt, and eventually reverse these stresses. Cultivating benthic polyculture algae within controlled open-field photobioreactors is a practical technique for exploiting the ubiquity and high...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>The Threat</strong><br/>The resource demands of Earth’s population, which may exceed eleven billion people by 2100 {United Nations, 2017, #94734}, will likely continue to intensify stresses on ecosystem services {Boyd and Banzhaf, 2007, #49938; World Resources Institute, 2005, #12568}. Among the most pressing threats is transgression of key planetary boundaries by overloading of the global N and P biogeochemical cycles via excess agricultural fertilizer/manure application and incompletely treated sewage {Bouwman et al....</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Wetlands</strong><br/>As C, N, and P cycle globally, and their chemical compounds become dilute and pervasive once released into the environment, projects to appreciably sequester or recycle them must be globally distributed at large scale. One practice intended to mitigate dilute N and P pollution is the constructed treatment wetland (CTW) {Hoffmann et al., 2011, #95223; Kivaisi, 2001, #28974; Vymazal, 2010, #45132}.

<p class="binderItem"><strong>ATS Intro</strong><br/>Here we evaluate the capability of the algae cultivation practice known as algal turf scrubbing (ATS) {Stewart, 2004, #96157; Adey et al., 2011, #74672} to intervene in humanity’s overloading of the N, P, and C biogeochemical cycles. One of us (Adey) is the inventor of this process, a reliable technology that harnesses rapidly growing benthic algal polycultures, also known as periphyton, confined within an open-field photobioreactor, to photosynthetically remove N, P, C, and other aquatic pollut...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Description</strong><br/>An ATS facility is characterized by a shallow, flat, inclined (0.5-2% slope) exposed surface (the floway) (Fig. 1A), either roughened or lined with a high surface-area fabric to provide a growth substratum. A wave- or pulse-generator directs influent into the floway along its upper contour (Fig. 1A,B), producing a shallow (2-5 cm (0.7 - 2 in) deep) flow coursing downslope. Cells of diverse algal taxa, ubiquitous in surface waters, adhere to the substratum and rapidly propagate, maturing into a c...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>ATS Operation</strong><br/>Typically, ATS operates in a single-pass mode, with influent traversing the floway once before returning to its source. Multiple passes may instead be performed, either with the effluent from one floway used as the influent for another, emulating a single longer floway, or by recirculating water through the same floway multiple times before discharge. A typical production-scale facility occupies ~1 ha, treating ~4.0 × 107 L d-1 (~1.1 × 107 gal d-1), with larger volumes handled using multiple ins...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Biomass Fate</strong><br/>Because the effectiveness of an ATS facility at removing N and P pollution correlates with its biomass productivity, the fate of the biomass is an essential consideration for project planning, ideally producing revenue to help offset treatment costs. Biomass produced from waters with low toxin concentrations toxins could be used in agriculture as a fertilizer/soil amendment {Mulbry et al., 2005, #24501}, as a source of compost {Shiralipour and Epstein, 2005, #22388}, or as an animal or fish feed...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Limitations</strong><br/>Our approach suffers from several limitations. Because we approximate the effort needed to globally recycle pollutants, rather than create a detailed simulation, we chose a round number (100 years) for our project duration, and a simple algorithm for spending: exponential growth starting at a defined spending rate and ending at a level that satisfies the pollutant recycling rate. This approach to financing and schedule is rudimentary, but the large scale of our proposed intervention makes it pra...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Nutrient Excesses</strong><br/>It is no surprise that the highest priority basins for N and P recycling are also the major highly productive agricultural basins. These basins are among the largest in surface area, and can thus be expected to be responsible for the majority of nutrient flows. This situation is compounded by the fact that agriculture is a low-margin enterprise. To maintain economic viability a farm must provide as much product per hectare as possible annually, often ignoring long-term considerations such as soi...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Success Indicators</strong><br/>Because so much investment is required for complete N and P recycling, let alone C recycling, it may be prudent to start with projects of a scale affording early and definitive measures of success. The current global ecological situation derives from centuries of increasing human impact on ecosystem services. Centuries of increasing countermeasures might be required to completely reverse the damage. Initially, only local effects will be easily discernible, so focusing most of the initial investm...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Surfaces</strong><br/>Recent experiments have demonstrated greater than twofold improvement in ATS™ biomass productivity using three-dimensional growth substrata rather than the usual two-dimensional screens {Adey et al., 2013, #773}. To understand this higher productivity it may be worth considering the importance of surface topography at multiple scales, starting with the molecular.

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Concerns - Emissions, Biomass, Land Area</strong><br/>The scale of our proposed intervention prompts concerns about environmental impacts. For example, algal biomass that concentrate toxins found in polluted water may itself be classified as toxic waste, requiring additional processing to render it suitable for further applications. Biofuel production could remove up to half of the biomass as carbon, doubling the concentration of toxins in the residue and reducing landfill volumes and transportation costs compared to the original biomass.

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Sociopolitical Obstacles</strong><br/>Sociopolitical and economic obstacles are more likely than technical ones to impede rapid expansion of algal cultivation. The continued growth in severity and size of HABs worldwide, in the presence of demands or mandates to address them demonstrates that the responsible political and commercial regimes can be reluctant to either create public goods of the required extent or mitigate inevitable ecosystem damage.
