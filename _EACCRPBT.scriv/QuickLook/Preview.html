<p class="binderItem"><strong>Abstract</strong><br/>Humanity is degrading multiple ecosystem services, potentially irreversibly. Two of the most important human impacts appear to be excess agricultural nutrient loading in our fresh and estuarine waters and excess carbon dioxide in our oceans and atmosphere. Global large-scale intervention is required to slow, halt, and eventually reverse these stresses. Cultivating benthic polyculture algae within controlled open-field photobioreactors is a practical technique for exploiting the ubiquity and high...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>The Threat</strong><br/>The resource demands of Earth’s population, which may exceed eleven billion people by 2100 {United Nations, 2015, #94734}, will likely continue to intensify stresses on ecosystem services {Boyd and Banzhaf, 2007, #49938}. Excess agricultural fertilizer/manure application, upon which high-performance agriculture depends, and incompletely treated sewage, a consequence of inadequate infrastructure investment, are overloading the biogeochemical N and P cycles, one of the most pressing threats {Steff...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Wetlands</strong><br/>As C, N, and P cycle globally, and their chemical compounds become dilute and pervasive once released into the environment, projects to appreciably sequester or recycle them must be globally distributed at large scale {Shortle and Horan, 2001, #95650}. One practice intended to mitigate dilute N and P pollution is the constructed treatment wetland (CTW) {Vymazal, 2010, #45132}. CTWs embed some excess P in the soil while volatilizing much of the excess N, and to a lesser extent sequester these nut...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Other Solutions</strong><br/>Where concentrated pollutants are released, as from sewage treatment plants or factories, effective industrial treatment is feasible but expensive, and is actively, if sporadically, performed mostly in wealthy countries {Environmental Protection Agency, 2007, #89392}. However, even with cleanup of concentrated N and P via expanded industrial treatment {Ribaudo et al., 2001, #100325}, agriculture unavoidably produces global nonpoint N and P pollution from application of fertilizer and manure that...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>ATS Intro</strong><br/>Here we evaluate the capability of the algae cultivation practice known as algal turf scrubbing (ATS) {Adey et al., 2011, #74672} to intervene in humanity’s overloading of the N, P, and C biogeochemical cycles. One of us (Adey) is the inventor of this process, a reliable technology that harnesses rapidly growing benthic algal polycultures, also known as periphyton, confined within an open-field photobioreactor, to photosynthetically remove N, P, C, and other aquatic pollutants from point and non...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Description</strong><br/>An ATS facility is characterized by a shallow, inclined (0.5-2% slope) exposed surface (the floway) (Fig. 1A), either roughened or lined with a high surface-area mesh to provide a growth substratum. A wave- or pulse-generator directs influent into the floway along its upper contour (Fig. 1A,B), producing a shallow (2-5 cm (0.7 - 2 in) deep) flow coursing downslope. Cells of diverse algal taxa, ubiquitous in surface waters, adhere to the substratum and rapidly propagate, maturing into a community...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>ATS Operation</strong><br/>Typically, ATS operates in a single-pass mode, with influent traversing the floway once before returning to its source. Single-pass mode requires less capital and operational expense (CapEx and OpEx) than more complex operational modes, but can usually accomplish only 5-15% removal of N and P, as carbon limitation, arising along the floway due to removal of this nutrient as it is incorporated into biomass, reduces areal productivity and thus nutrient uptake. Introducing CO2 at intervals along th...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Floway Chemistry</strong><br/>During photosynthesis, a floway’s oxygen concentration rises while carbon fixation drives the carbonate/bicarbonate buffer system towards its higher-pH, carbonate dominated profile, further upgrading the water beyond merely cleaning it of pollutants, if it can be mixed with “acidified” water whose pH is too low. Where the water is high in nutrient pollution, the floway can become carbon limited, reaching a pH of 9.5 or higher and allowing phosphate salts to precipitate. Carbon limitation is acco...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Biomass Fate</strong><br/>Because the effectiveness of an ATS facility correlates with its areal productivity, the fate of the biomass is an essential consideration for project planning, ideally producing revenue to help offset treatment costs. Biomass produced from waters with low enough concentrations of toxic species could be used in agriculture as a fertilizer/soil amendment. Biomass whose toxin concentration is unacceptable fertilizer use must be processed to reduce toxin concentration if used to grow food, used for...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>ATS and Planetary Boundaries</strong><br/>If globally distributed throughout the world’s river basins at large enough scale, ATS could directly reverse the transgressions of planetary boundaries {Steffen et al., 2015, #78923} involving N and P cycling. Here we estimate the scope of such an intervention both from a global perspective and by prioritizing some of the 405 major hydrological basins, based on publicly available nutrient and geospatial datasets. We discuss potential issues with land availability, CapEx and OpEx, and sociopolit...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Summary</strong><br/>Here we illustrate the contribution of global agriculture to impending transgressions of planetary boundaries involving biogeochemical cycling (Fig. 2A-B) {Steffen et al., 2015, #78923}, and estimate the magnitude of the investment required to counteract these transgressions using benthic algal cultivation implemented by ATS. If effect we are modeling a return to pre-industrial conditions of all freshwater drainage. Such a complete effort may not be strictly necessary, but this conservative stan...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Limitations</strong><br/>Our approach suffers from several limitations. Because we approximate the effort needed to globally recycle pollutants, rather than create a detailed simulation, we chose a round number (100 years) for our project duration, and a simple algorithm for spending: exponential growth starting at a defined spending rate and ending at a level that satisfies the pollutant recycling rate. This approach to financing and schedule is rudimentary, but the large scale of our proposed intervention makes it pra...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Nutrient Excesses</strong><br/>It is no surprise that the highest priority basins for N and P recycling are also the major highly productive agricultural basins. These basins are among the largest in surface area, and can thus be expected to be responsible for the majority of nutrient flows. This situation is compounded by the fact that agriculture is a low-margin enterprise. To maintain economic viability a farm must provide as much product per hectare as possible annually, often ignoring long-term considerations such as soi...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Success Indicators</strong><br/>Because so much investment is required for complete N and P recycling, let alone C recycling, it may be prudent to start with projects of a scale affording early and definitive measures of success. The current global ecological situation derives from centuries of increasing human impact on ecosystem services. Centuries of increasing countermeasures might be required to completely reverse the damage. Initially, only local effects will be easily discernible, so focusing most of the initial investm...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Surfaces</strong><br/>Recent experiments have demonstrated greater than twofold improvement in ATS™ biomass productivity using three-dimensional growth substrata rather than the usual two-dimensional screens {Adey et al., 2013, #773}. To understand this higher productivity it may be worth considering the importance of surface topography at multiple scales, starting with the molecular. Surfaces can catalyze chemical reactions by spatially organizing a population of reactant molecules according to a geometry that favor...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Concerns - Emissions, Biomass, Land Area</strong><br/>The scale of our proposed intervention prompts concerns about environmental impacts. For example, algal biomass that concentrate toxins found in polluted water may itself be classified as toxic waste, requiring additional processing to render it suitable for further applications. Biofuel production could remove up to half of the biomass as carbon, doubling the concentration of toxins in the residue and reducing landfill volumes and transportation costs compared to the original biomass. An effect...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Sociopolitical Obstacles</strong><br/>Sociopolitical and economic obstacles are more likely than technical ones to impede rapid expansion of algal cultivation. The continued growth in severity and size of HABs worldwide, in the presence of demands or mandates to address them demonstrates that the responsible political and commercial regimes can be reluctant to either create public goods of the required extent or mitigate inevitable ecosystem damage. However, in some jurisdictions progress has occurred. For example, governments of US...</p>
