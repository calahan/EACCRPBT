\f0\fs32 \cf0 EACCRPBT.xlsx provides a user-friendly interface for determining parameters to be used in the economic model described in the manuscript. Various assumptions and conversion factors are used to refine the input parameters to the model, which runs by loading the variables directly from the workbook \'93R Variables\'94.  The names and values of future R variables, assigned in the file \'93Settings.R\'94, are  stored in columns A and B, with the relevant SI-derived unit stored in column C and the USCS value and unit stored in columns D and E. The values of the future R variables are calculated using the other several worksheets.}
