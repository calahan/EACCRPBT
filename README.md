The code in this repository accesses geospatial data obtained from EarthStat, the
Global Runoff Data Center (GRDC), and NaturalEarth. The data file locations and/or
formats may have changed since our accession or in the future (see references in
the manuscript for accession details), so both the following information and the
code itself may need to be modified to correctly handle these potential changes.
